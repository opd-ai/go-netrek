# Circuit Breaker Implementation

This document describes the circuit breaker implementation for go-netrek, which provides resilient network operations to prevent cascading failures.

## Overview

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking operations that are likely to fail. This implementation wraps all network operations in the `GameClient` with circuit breaker protection and retry logic.

## Configuration

Circuit breaker behavior is configured via environment variables:

```bash
# Maximum requests allowed in half-open state (default: 3)
NETREK_CB_MAX_REQUESTS=3

# Time interval to reset failure counter (default: 60s)
NETREK_CB_INTERVAL=60s

# Time to wait before transitioning from open to half-open (default: 30s)
NETREK_CB_TIMEOUT=30s

# Number of consecutive failures before tripping the circuit (default: 5)
NETREK_CB_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILS=5
```

## States

The circuit breaker has three states:

1. **Closed** (Normal): All requests pass through normally
2. **Open** (Failing): All requests fail immediately without hitting the server
3. **Half-Open** (Testing): Limited requests allowed to test if service recovered

## Features

### Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff

Operations are automatically retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff:
- First retry: 1 second delay
- Second retry: 2 second delay  
- Third retry: 3 second delay

### Context-Aware Operations

All operations respect context cancellation and timeouts:

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)
defer cancel()

err := client.SendInput(ctx, input)
```

### Structured Logging

Circuit breaker events are logged with correlation IDs:

```json
{
  "time": "2025-07-22T21:10:07.915088Z",
  "level": "INFO", 
  "msg": "circuit breaker state changed",
  "name": "netrek-network",
  "from": "closed",
  "to": "open"
}
```

## Integration

### GameClient Integration

The `GameClient` automatically uses circuit breaker protection for:

- Connection establishment (`Connect()`)
- Message sending (`SendInput()`, `SendChatMessage()`)
- All network operations

### Server Protection

Circuit breaker prevents clients from overwhelming a recovering server by:

- Failing fast when circuit is open
- Limiting concurrent requests during recovery
- Providing immediate feedback to users

## Monitoring

### State Inspection

Monitor circuit breaker health:

```go
state := client.networkService.GetState()
counts := client.networkService.GetCounts()

fmt.Printf("State: %v, Failures: %d, Successes: %d\n", 
    state, counts.TotalFailures, counts.TotalSuccesses)
```

### Metrics

Key metrics to monitor:

- Circuit breaker state transitions
- Request success/failure rates
- Recovery time after failures
- Retry attempt patterns

## Best Practices

### Configuration Tuning

- **MaxRequests**: Keep low (3-5) to limit load during recovery
- **Interval**: Set to 60s for game clients (allows reasonable recovery time)
- **Timeout**: Set to 30s (matches typical connection timeouts)
- **MaxConsecutiveFails**: Set to 5 (balances sensitivity vs. stability)

### Error Handling

Always handle circuit breaker errors gracefully:

```go
err := client.SendInput(input)
if err != nil {
    // Circuit may be open - inform user and try again later
    displayError("Connection unstable, retrying...")
    return
}
```

### Testing

Circuit breaker behavior should be tested with:

- Simulated network failures
- Server unavailability scenarios
- Recovery testing
- Load testing with multiple clients

## Fallback Strategies

When circuit breaker is open:

1. **Cache Last Known State**: Display last known game state
2. **Queue Operations**: Buffer non-critical operations for retry
3. **User Feedback**: Inform user of connection issues
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Reduce functionality rather than failing completely

## Performance Impact

Circuit breaker overhead is minimal:

- ~1-2Î¼s per operation when circuit is closed
- No network calls when circuit is open (saves significant time)
- Memory usage: ~100 bytes per circuit breaker instance

## Troubleshooting

### Circuit Won't Close

- Check server availability
- Verify network connectivity  
- Review failure threshold configuration
- Check logs for specific error patterns

### Too Many False Positives

- Increase `MaxConsecutiveFails` threshold
- Extend `Interval` duration
- Review network timeout settings
- Check for intermittent connectivity issues

### Slow Recovery

- Decrease `Timeout` duration
- Increase `MaxRequests` in half-open state
- Review server startup time
- Check load balancer health checks

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety

All circuit breaker operations are thread-safe and can be called concurrently from multiple goroutines.

### Memory Management

Circuit breaker state is managed in-memory with minimal allocation overhead. No external dependencies required.

### Graceful Shutdown

Circuit breaker respects context cancellation and will not block shutdown operations.
