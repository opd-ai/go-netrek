# Go Netrek Functional Audit Report

## AUDIT SUMMARY

````
**Total Issues Found: 1**
- **CRITICAL BUGS: 0**
- **FUNCTIONAL MISMATCHES: 1** 
- **MISSING FEATURES: 0**
- **EDGE CASE BUGS: 0**
- **PERFORMANCE ISSUES: 0**

**Audit Scope:** Complete codebase analysis following dependency-based examination of 59 Go source files
**Analysis Method:** Bottom-up dependency analysis starting with Level 0 files (physics, event) progressing through entity, network, engine, and application layers
**Documentation Base:** README.md functional requirements and architectural specifications
**Note:** Previous audit contained false positives that have been corrected upon closer examination

**FIXED ISSUES:**
- **FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Missing Galaxy Map Template System** - RESOLVED: Added comprehensive galaxy map template system with built-in templates (classic_netrek, small_galaxy, balanced_4team) and command-line support (--template, --list-templates flags). System now supports loading preset galaxy configurations as advertised in README.md.

## DETAILED FINDINGS

````
### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Missing Galaxy Map Template System - RESOLVED âœ…
**File:** pkg/config/config.go:1-577,pkg/engine/game.go:100-200
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The README.md advertises "Configurable game rules and galaxy maps" but while individual planets can be configured, there's no galaxy map template system for loading preset configurations with multiple galaxy layouts.
**Expected Behavior:** Support for loading different galaxy map configurations with preset planet layouts and tactical scenarios
**Actual Behavior:** Only individual planet configuration through JSON arrays, requiring manual specification of each planet
**Impact:** Limited ability to quickly set up different game scenarios or balanced maps
**Reproduction:** Look for galaxy map template loading functionality in config system
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Config supports individual planets but no comprehensive galaxy templates
"planets": [{"name": "Earth", "x": -4000, "y": 0, ...}]  
// Missing: galaxy map template system with preset layouts
```
**RESOLUTION:** Added comprehensive galaxy map template system with:
- Built-in templates: classic_netrek (4-team), small_galaxy (2-team), balanced_4team (4-team)
- Functions: GetGalaxyTemplate(), ListGalaxyTemplates(), ApplyGalaxyTemplate()
- Command-line support: --template flag, --list-templates flag
- Template system allows quick setup of different game scenarios as advertised

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Documentation Claims TCP-Only But Code Supports Any net.Conn
**File:** README.md:15, pkg/network/server.go:108, pkg/network/client.go:1-50
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The README.md specifically states "Real-time multiplayer over TCP/IP" implying TCP-only support, but the code actually uses net.Conn interfaces which support any connection type (TCP, Unix sockets, etc.).
**Expected Behavior:** Documentation should accurately reflect that the code supports any net.Conn implementation, not just TCP
**Actual Behavior:** Code is flexible and uses proper Go interfaces, but documentation incorrectly suggests TCP-only limitation
**Impact:** Documentation misleads users about network protocol flexibility
**Reproduction:** Review README.md networking claims vs actual net.Conn usage in code
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Code properly uses flexible interfaces
type Client struct {
    Conn net.Conn  // Supports any connection type
    // ...
}
// But README claims: "Real-time multiplayer over TCP/IP"
```

**Audit Completed:** July 25, 2025  
**Total Files Analyzed:** 59 Go source files  
**Analysis Method:** Dependency-based bottom-up examination  
**Reviewer:** Expert Go Code Auditor

**Corrections Made:** Initial audit contained multiple false positives that were corrected upon closer code examination:
- Ship class configuration integration IS implemented via SetShipTypeStats() called from config loading
- Planet conquest mechanics ARE implemented with BeamDownArmies() and BeamUpArmies() methods
- Default configuration creation IS implemented with --default flag handling
- Chat message support IS implemented with broadcastChatMessage() functionality  
- Win condition "conquest" IS implemented with checkConquestWin() method
- QuadTree operations ARE thread-safe via EntityLock synchronization in the game engine
- Network interface usage follows Go standards (net.Listener is the correct interface type)
- Vector normalization behavior IS properly documented in code comments explaining zero-vector handling
