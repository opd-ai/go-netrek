# Go Netrek Functional Audit Report

## AUDIT SUMMARY

````
**Total Issues Found: 3**
- **CRITICAL BUGS: 0**
- **FUNCTIONAL MISMATCHES: 1** 
- **MISSING FEATURES: 1**
- **EDGE CASE BUGS: 1**
- **PERFORMANCE ISSUES: 0**

**Audit Scope:** Complete codebase analysis following dependency-based examination of 59 Go source files

**Documentation Base:** README.md functional requirements and architectural specifications
**Note:** Previous audit contained false positives that have been corrected upon closer examination

## DETAILED FINDINGS

````
### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Missing Galaxy Map Template System
**File:** pkg/config/config.go:1-577,pkg/engine/game.go:100-200
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The README.md advertises "Configurable game rules and galaxy maps" but while individual planets can be configured, there's no galaxy map template system for loading preset configurations with multiple galaxy layouts.
**Expected Behavior:** Support for loading different galaxy map configurations with preset planet layouts and tactical scenarios
**Actual Behavior:** Only individual planet configuration through JSON arrays, requiring manual specification of each planet
**Impact:** Limited ability to quickly set up different game scenarios or balanced maps
**Reproduction:** Look for galaxy map template loading functionality in config system
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Config supports individual planets but no comprehensive galaxy templates
"planets": [{"name": "Earth", "x": -4000, "y": 0, ...}]  
// Missing: galaxy map template system with preset layouts
```

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Documentation Claims TCP-Only But Code Supports Any net.Conn
**File:** README.md:15, pkg/network/server.go:108, pkg/network/client.go:1-50
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The README.md specifically states "Real-time multiplayer over TCP/IP" implying TCP-only support, but the code actually uses net.Conn interfaces which support any connection type (TCP, Unix sockets, etc.).
**Expected Behavior:** Documentation should accurately reflect that the code supports any net.Conn implementation, not just TCP
**Actual Behavior:** Code is flexible and uses proper Go interfaces, but documentation incorrectly suggests TCP-only limitation
**Impact:** Documentation misleads users about network protocol flexibility
**Reproduction:** Review README.md networking claims vs actual net.Conn usage in code
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Code properly uses flexible interfaces
type Client struct {
    Conn net.Conn  // Supports any connection type
    // ...
}
// But README claims: "Real-time multiplayer over TCP/IP"
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Vector Normalization Default Inconsistency
**File:** pkg/physics/vector.go:40-48
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The Normalize method returns (1,0) for zero-length vectors, but this arbitrary choice may cause unexpected behavior in game physics calculations where zero vectors should remain zero or trigger special handling.
**Expected Behavior:** Zero vectors should either remain zero, return an error, or have documented behavior for the default direction
**Actual Behavior:** Always returns (1,0) which may cause ships with zero velocity to suddenly start moving east
**Impact:** Ships with zero velocity might unexpectedly acquire eastward momentum
**Reproduction:** Call Normalize() on Vector2D{0,0}
**Code Reference:**
```go
func (v Vector2D) Normalize() Vector2D {
	length := v.Length()
	if length == 0 {
		return Vector2D{X: 1, Y: 0}  // Arbitrary default may cause issues
	}
	return Vector2D{X: v.X / length, Y: v.Y / length}
}
```

**Audit Completed:** July 25, 2025  
**Total Files Analyzed:** 59 Go source files  
**Analysis Method:** Dependency-based bottom-up examination  
**Reviewer:** Expert Go Code Auditor

**Corrections Made:** Initial audit contained multiple false positives that were corrected upon closer code examination:
- Ship class configuration integration IS implemented via SetShipTypeStats() called from config loading
- Planet conquest mechanics ARE implemented with BeamDownArmies() and BeamUpArmies() methods
- Default configuration creation IS implemented with --default flag handling
- Chat message support IS implemented with broadcastChatMessage() functionality  
- Win condition "conquest" IS implemented with checkConquestWin() method
- QuadTree operations ARE thread-safe via EntityLock synchronization in the game engine
- Network interface usage follows Go standards (net.Listener is the correct interface type)
