## DETAILED FINDINGS

### FUNCTIONAL MISMATCH: Partial State Updates Not Fully Implemented
**File:** pkg/network/server.go:1-180
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** The README and config support partial state updates (`usePartialState`), but the server always sends full state updates every `ticksPerState` and does not implement logic for sending only changed entities between full updates.
**Expected Behavior:** When `usePartialState` is true, the server should send only changed entities between full state updates.
**Actual Behavior:** The code lacks logic to track and send only changed entities.
**Impact:** Increased bandwidth usage, especially with many entities, and does not match documented networking efficiency.
**Reproduction:** Run a game with many entities and `usePartialState` enabled; observe that all state is sent every update.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// No code for tracking/sending only changed entities between full updates
```

### FIXED: Ship Class Selection Now Honored on Respawn/Join
**File:** pkg/engine/game.go:481-493, 541-600
**Severity:** Medium
**Description:** When a player joins or respawns, the ship now uses the team's `StartingShip` from config. See commit: "Honor team StartingShip config for player join/respawn".
**Resolution Date:** 2025-07-19

### MISSING FEATURE: Custom Game Rules Extensibility
**File:** pkg/engine/game.go:953, README.md
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** README claims custom game rules can be implemented in `pkg/engine/game.go`, but the code does not provide a plugin or interface mechanism for adding new rules without modifying core logic.
**Expected Behavior:** There should be a documented interface or hook for adding new win conditions or rules.
**Actual Behavior:** All rules are hardcoded; no extensibility points are provided.
**Impact:** Developers must modify core files to add new rules, reducing modularity and maintainability.
**Reproduction:** Attempt to add a new win condition or rule without editing `game.go` directly.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// All win condition logic is hardcoded in endGame() and event handlers
```

### MISSING FEATURE: Configurable Ship/Planet/Weapon Types via JSON
**File:** pkg/config/config.go:1-166, README.md
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The README and config example suggest that new ship classes, planet types, and weapons can be added via JSON config, but the code only supports hardcoded types and does not parse or instantiate new types from config.
**Expected Behavior:** The system should allow new ship/planet/weapon types to be defined in config and instantiated at runtime.
**Actual Behavior:** Only predefined types in Go code are supported.
**Impact:** Limits extensibility and contradicts documentation.
**Reproduction:** Add a new ship or weapon type to the config JSON and attempt to use it in-game.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// Only hardcoded types in entity/ship.go, entity/planet.go, entity/weapon.go
```

### EDGE CASE BUG: Ship/Projectile World Wrapping May Cause Overlap
**File:** pkg/engine/game.go:241-300
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The `wrapEntityPosition` function wraps ships/projectiles at world boundaries, but does not check for overlap with other entities after wrapping, potentially causing instant collisions or stacking.
**Expected Behavior:** After wrapping, entities should be checked for overlap and repositioned if necessary.
**Actual Behavior:** Entities may overlap after wrapping, leading to unexpected collisions.
**Impact:** Can cause unfair deaths or glitches at world edges.
**Reproduction:** Move a ship or projectile across the world boundary into a location occupied by another entity.
**Code Reference:**
```go
// No overlap check after position wrap
```

### PERFORMANCE ISSUE: Inefficient QuadTree Rebuilding Every Frame
**File:** pkg/engine/game.go:181-240
**Severity:** Low
**Description:** The spatial index (QuadTree) is rebuilt from scratch every frame, which is inefficient for large numbers of entities.
**Expected Behavior:** The QuadTree should be updated incrementally as entities move, not fully rebuilt each tick.
**Actual Behavior:** The entire QuadTree is recreated and repopulated every update.
**Impact:** Increased CPU usage and potential lag with many entities.
**Reproduction:** Run a game with many entities and profile CPU usage.
**Code Reference:**
```go
g.SpatialIndex = physics.NewQuadTree(...)
```
